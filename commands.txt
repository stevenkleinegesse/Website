Build the local static website with

	hugo server

which is available at localhost:1313.

Create a new publication with

Once the information in "publication/Publication-Name-With-Hyphens-Between-Letters/index.md" is edited, deploy the website with

./deploy.sh "Commit Message"

Afterwards, don't forget to stage and push commits to the Website repo as well with

git add .
git commit -m "Commit Message"
git push origin master
