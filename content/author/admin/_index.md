I am a PhD student at the Centre of Doctoral Training (CDT) in Data Science at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests include Bayesian experimental design, likelihood-free inference and Bayesian optimisation. Prior to being a PhD student, I graduated with a Master of Science in Physics from Imperial College London, where I specialised in Astrophysics and Particle Physics.
