I'm a Lead Research Scientist in Machine Learning at causaLens, a London-based deeptech start-up. I develop novel machine learning solutions that understand cause and effect. I care about building customer-centric products that scale well.

I hold a PhD in Machine Learning from the University of Edinburgh. My thesis focussed on developing machine learning solutions that can tell scientists which experiments to perform in order to maximize information gain and minimize costs. Specifically, the relevant topics included Machine Learning, Bayesian Experimental Design, Likelihood-Free Inference, and Bayesian Optimisation. Prior to being a PhD student, I graduated with a Master of Science in Physics from Imperial College London, where I specialised in Astrophysics and Particle Physics.
